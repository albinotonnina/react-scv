<p align="center">Create React modules with zero configuration needed</p>

## What is it about?

This library allows you to create "React modules" with zero configuration needed.

## What do you mean with "React modules"?

We mean a project that:

- Is a React "web application" that can be served statically on a server.
- Is also a "library" that can be imported by other projects as an npm dependency.

## How to create a new project?

```bash
mkdir -p <project-name>/node_modules && cd <project-name>
npm install react-scv
node_modules/.bin/react-scv init # and follow the prompts
```

Is important to notice that your new project doesn't contain any configuration file, it just works.

## What features I get for free in my new project?

- React
- Webpack
- Webpack DLLs
- Webpack proxy (useful to avoid CORS during development)
- react-hot-loader 3.0
- Babel with ES2015, Stage 0 and React presets
- Tests and coverage with Jest
- Enzyme
- Sass
- CSS modules (for files with extension .cssm or .scssm)
- ESLint

## How to work with my new project?

- Serve your web application on a devServer with hot-reload using `npm run start`, the entry point of your web application is `src/app.js`.
- Add your code in `src/` and `tests/`.
- Run your tests with `npm run test`.
- Do some ES6 exports in `src/module/index.js` to make the exported objects available to the users of your library.
- Distribute both the web application and the library running `npm run build`.

## Info about the build result

Running `npm run build` will produce

- A folder `build/app` containing your web application. Serve the content of this folder on a web server and enjoy your app in production.
- A folder `build/umd` containing the transpiled code of your library.

## What if I don't care about the web application part of the build?

You can delete the file `src/app.js` and forget about it, from now on, you will only get the UMD part when running `npm run build`

## What if I don't care about the library part of the build?

You can delete the file `src/module/index.js` and forget about it, from now on, you will only get the "React web application" part when running `npm run build`

## Info about your new project contents

- `src/app.js` is used as entry point to serve and build your project as a web application, contents not included in this file will not be served by `npm run start` and will not be built by `npm run build`.
- `src/module/index.js` is used as entry point for the library produced by `npm run build`, contents not included in this file will not be part of the library.

The rest of the project should be self explanatory.

## Optional - Configuration, some basic stuff

A subset of the module features can be configured directly through the `react-scv` section in the package.json:

```javascript
"react-scv": {
  "appBuildEntry": "src/app.js", //the entry point of your web application
  "umdBuildEntry": "src/module/index.js", //the entry point of your library
  "html": { //doc here: https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#configuration
    "title": "the title of your app",
    "description": "the description of your app"
  },
  "devServer":{
    "port": "4000",
    "proxy": { //doc here: https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#proxy
      "/api": { //proxies the api call to the /api path (useful to avoid CORS during development)
        "target": "https://anIP/aContextPath",
        "changeOrigin": true,
        "secure": false,
        "logLevel": "debug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Optional - Customize react-scv in your project (if you want that extra feature so bad)

All the configuration files used by react-scv are at this path <a href="https://github.com/marcellomontemagno/react-scv/tree/master/config" target="_blank">here</a> before customizing something please take your time to have a look on what is there.

A subset of the configuration files can be extended/overridden, Here the files you can extend/override:

- `webpack.app.js` //used to build your web application during `build`
- `webpack.dev.js` //used to serve your application during `start`
- `webpack.umd.js` //used to build your library UMD during `build`
- `dlls.js` //the npm dependencies that will be included in the webpack DLLs during `build` and `start`
- `eslint.dev.js` //used to lint the code during `start`
- `eslint.prod.js` //used to lint the code during `build`
- `jest.js` //used to run the tests during `test`

### overriding/extending `webpack.app.js`, `webpack.dev.js` or `webpack.umd.js`

- create a file with the same name under `yourProjectRoot/react-scv/`
- the new file must export a function with this signature: `const newWebpackConfig = yourFunction(oldWebpackConfig, cursors);`

Here an example of how to add a new loader to `webpack.app.js`

```javascript
//this is the content of the file yourProjectRoot/react-scv/webpack.app.js

const WebpackVisualizerPlugin = require('webpack-visualizer-plugin');

module.exports = function(config){
    config.plugins.push(new WebpackVisualizerPlugin()); //modifies the webpack configuration object where needed
    return config;
};
```

We know that overriding webpack loaders and plugins can be difficult, for this reason we are providing [cursorify](https://github.com/marcellomontemagno/cursorify/) cursors as a second argument of the function you implement.
Here an example of how to override a loader using a [cursorify](https://github.com/marcellomontemagno/cursorify/) cursor:

```javascript
//this is the content of the file yourProjectRoot/react-scv/webpack.app.js

const setByCursor = require('cursorify').setByCursor;

module.exports = function (config, cursors) {

  const newSvgLoadingRule = {
    test: /\.svg(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
    loaders: [
      'svg-inline-loader', {
        loader: 'image-webpack-loader',
        options: {
          svgo: {
            plugins: [
              {
                removeStyleElement: true
              },
              {
                removeXMLNS: true
              },
              {
                removeDimensions: true
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }

  setByCursor(config, cursors['svg-rule'], newSvgLoadingRule); //overrides the existing rule using the cursor named 'svg-rule'

  return config;

};
```

### overriding/extending `jest.js`, `eslint.dev.js`, `eslint.prod.js` or `dlls.js`:

- create a file with the same name under `yourProjectRoot/react-scv/`
- the new file must export an object

here an example of how to change change a rule in `eslint.dev.js`

```javascript
//this is the content of the file yourProjectRoot/react-scv/eslint.dev.js
const deepmerge = require('deepmerge');
const config = require('react-scv/config/eslint.dev');
module.exports = deepmerge(config, {
  rules: {
    'no-console': 1
  }
});
```

## About overriding/extending:

When overriding something please keep in mind that

- you have to pay attention, we give you full freedom on what you can change, you are basically changing the react-scv code, this means, you might break something
- don't go crazy, you will need to maintain your customizations, migrating to a future version of react-scv might be difficult if you add too many features
- if you think <<oh maaaan, that extra feature I just added is sooo gooood>> you might help react-scv to include it in its the next release with a pull request instead of having a customization in your project ðŸ˜Š

## Info about browser globals and your UMD

When developing and running your module and with `npm run start` you will be able to access the globals presents in the 'babel-polyfill' and 'whatwg-fetch' npm modules (e.g window.fetch).
When you are distributing your UMD with `npm run build` the UMD will not contains 'babel-polyfill' and 'whatwg-fetch', so if you used any of these globals in your UMD code the environment where the UMD is running must provide them.
